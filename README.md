📊 eCommerce-Data-Analysis

This project presents a detailed analysis of an online retail dataset, covering data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, time series trends, and customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis.

🔧 Tools & Technologies:
1.Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)
2.Jupyter Notebook
3.Data Cleaning & Wrangling
4.Time Series Analysis
5.RFM Segmentation

🧪 Process
---->Data Cleaning & Preparation:
1.Handled missing values and removed duplicates.
2.Filtered out canceled transactions and invalid stock codes.
3.Converted InvoiceDate to datetime and calculated total sales per transaction.

---->EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):
