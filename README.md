📊 eCommerce-Data-Analysis

This project presents a detailed analysis of an online retail dataset, covering data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, time series trends, and customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis.

🔧 Tools & Technologies:
1.Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)
2.Jupyter Notebook
3.Data Cleaning & Wrangling
4.Time Series Analysis
5.RFM Segmentation
6. Power Bi For Visualization

🧪 Process
---->Data Cleaning & Preparation:
1.Handled missing values and removed duplicates.
2.Filtered out canceled transactions and invalid stock codes.
3.Converted InvoiceDate to datetime and calculated total sales per transaction.

---->EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):
1.Analyzed quantity and unit price distributions.
2.Identified top-selling products and countries.
3.Explored time trends in daily and monthly sales.

---->Pareto Analysis:
1.Verified that ~20% of customers/products contribute to ~80% of sales and sales volume.

---->RFM Analysis:
1.Computed Recency, Frequency, and Monetary scores.
2.Segmented customers into High Value, Loyal, At-Risk, and Dormant.

 🔍 Key Business Insights
- No sales were recorded on Saturdays.
- November showed the highest sales across the year.
- Top 26% of customers accounted for 80% of total revenue (Pareto Principle).
- UK leads sales with over 89% of total orders.
